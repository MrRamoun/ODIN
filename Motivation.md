# Motivation and Mindset

## why you have decided to learn programming?

- Do you want to have a **fulfilling career that pays well**?(1)
- Are you excited by the creative outlet programming provides?
- Are you determined to develop the skills and abilities to **build any app you can think of**?(2)
- Do you want to start your own company by turning an app idea into reality? 

> **Note**: Your motivation could be a combination of these reasons or something else entirely. Whatever it is, hold on tightly to your motivation - this will be what pulls you through to the end of this journey, giving you a definitive goal to aim towards.

## Growth Mindset

Your mindset is very important when teaching yourself any new skills, not just programming. Your mindset will have more of an impact on your chances of success than just about anything else.

Someone with the **fixed mindset** believes _if they don’t get something on their first attempt, they never will_. They believe that they simply aren’t smart enough to be able to do or understand some things.

However, there is a wide body of research showing that intelligence is not fixed but can instead be developed. Someone with the **growth mindset** believes _they can get better at anything with effort and persistence_.

What does this mean for you? It means you can _learn new skills and develop new talents with **persistence** and **grit**_.

There will be many times throughout The Odin Project that you will get stuck on a concept or a programming problem and may find yourself questioning your ability to learn programming. When you find yourself in this position, _remind yourself that you may not get it yet but that with persistence and grit you will_. Struggling with something is growth. **It doesn’t matter how long you struggle with a concept or project; all that matters is that you have the grit and tenacity to see it through**. That’s how real learning happens.

While you’re working through the curriculum, embrace the struggles you encounter with difficult concepts and complex projects. Be sure to celebrate your persistence at overcoming those struggles!

> **Note**: When you find yourself questioning your abilities, _reflect on the successes_ you have already achieved while learning to program: _the projects you have completed and the concepts you once didn’t understand but now do_. This is all the proof you need that you can do it.

## The Learning Process

Learning concepts and then practicing them will help you to more fully understand how things work and fit together. **Projects** are the ultimate method for ensuring that your _theoretical_ understanding aligns with how the programming concepts and techniques _actually operate_.

When learning, your mind will consistently switch between focus mode and diffuse mode. **Focus mode** occurs _when you are consciously focusing on learning, reading, watching videos, or working on a project_. **Diffuse mode** occurs subconsciously, at times _when you are not actively learning, such as when you’re doing the dishes, exercising, or sleeping_. In this state, your mind goes about the business of connecting what you have been learning to the other things you know. This is where breakthroughs happen.

It’s important to know that your mind goes through these two states when learning because _you can utilise this to make your learning more efficient_. When stuck on a concept or project, taking a break to refresh and let your subconscious work on making connections more often than not yields a solution to your problem. The trick is to put effort into solving the problem first and then take a break.

In short, understand it, practice it, and finally teach it.

Teaching what you know to others is a great way to solidify what you have learned and can often reveal holes in your knowledge that you wouldn’t have identified otherwise.

You can practice this method of learning by helping others in our community.
