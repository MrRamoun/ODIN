# intro to web dev

Presented by [theodingproject](https://theodinproject.com).

Here, you'll find everything you need in order to persue a career in web dev (you'll visit this file a lot).

## Characteristics of Web Dev.

Web development could be a good profession for you if you like:
- solving logical problems.
- building useful things.
- experimenting with new technologies.

## Types of Web Dev.

- **The front end** 

    is the stuff you see on the website in your browser, including _the presentation of content_ and _user interface elements_ like the navigation bar. Front-end developers use _HTML, CSS, JavaScript_, and their relevant frameworks __to ensure that content is presented effectively and that users have an excellent experience__.

    > **Note**: Front-End represents everything to the user and it has to have the key elements of _art_ and _design_. Like any creation, it should follow the __R16__ rules of creation.

    > **Note**:  Strong front-end developers can also accurately identify specific issues in user experience and provide recommendations and codified solutions to influence the design. It’s also important to be able to fluidly partner with other teams across the business to understand specific goals, needs, and opportunities, and then execute on those directives.

- **The back end** 

  refers to the guts of the application, which live on the server. The back end _stores and serves program data to ensure that the front end has what it needs_. This process can become very complicated when a website has millions of users. Back-end developers use programming languages like Java, Python, and Ruby to work with data.

  > **Note**: Back-End represents the logic and performance, so it needs high programming & engineering knowledge. It should also Follow The __R16__ guide.

  > **Note**: The back end of a website consists of a _server_, an _application_, and a _database_.

  > **Note**: Back-end create or contribute to web applications with clean, portable, well-documented code.

  > **Note**: before writing code, they need to collaborate with business stakeholders to understand their particular needs, then translate those into technical requirements and come up with the most effective and efficient solution for architecting the technology.

- **Full-stack developers**

   are comfortable working with both the front and back ends. In The Odin Project, we focus on teaching you full-stack development, covering all aspects of web development.

   ![fullstack-present](https://s3.amazonaws.com/external_clips/attachments/34760/original/full-stack.png?1417393522) This is an image of how fullstack tools look like currently.

   Regardless of the specific tools, dependent on the project or client at hand, full stack developers should be knowledgeable in every level of _how the web works_: _setting up and configuring Linux servers_, _writing server-side APIs_, diving into the  _client-side JavaScript powering an app_-lication, and turning a “design eye” to the CSS.

    Using these tools, full stack developers need to be able to immediately identify the client- and server-side responsibilities of a solution and articulate the pros and cons of various solutions.

    > **Note**: A full stack developer would be responsible for the entire flow of your experience with this blog post, from its _load time_ and _layout_ to its _interactiveness_ and _structural underpinnings_.

## The Bottom Line

no matter the type of development you’re thinking of pursuing, soft skills like:

- attention to details.
- ability to learn quickly.
- ability to solve problems efficiently.
- strong communication.
  
will stand you in good stead on top of the hard skills outlined above.

## Types of Careers

The different types of clients and employers you may work with.

- **Large tech companies**, such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon, have very stringent hiring requirements. If you successfully meet these expectations, they offer excellent pay, benefits, and opportunities.

- **Startups** are a bit like the wild west. For a junior developer, it can feel like a trial by fire because of the pace of development. Startups often offer slightly lower salaries and require longer hours, but they may also offer equity in the company and highly unique environments.

- As a **freelancer**, you could command a strong hourly wage and the freedom to schedule and design your own products. However, you would be responsible for getting your own work (which means less coding time), managing billing from clients (which can be difficult), and being solely responsible. Strong people skills are necessary for this path.

- As a **consultant for a web consultancy**, you would give up some of your freelancing wage potential but be able to focus more on the code and less on the hustle. This option also provides a good work/life balance and pay.

- Finally, **large, older companies** still need web developers. These companies offer a good work/life balance, pay, and benefits but often move slower than a company that is highly focused on tech.

## Tools of the Trade

    - Computer
    - Google
    - Text Editor
    - Command Line Interface - (CLI)
    - Stack Overflow
    - Git
    - GitHub

## Motivation

The strongest assets you can have as a student are:
- a desire to build.
- a problem-solving mind. 
- persistence in the face of setbacks.

> **Note**: people tend to care more about what you’ve actually __built__ than how you got there.

> **Tip**: Once you start to feel comfortable with the tools, start hacking on open source projects ([like The Odin project itself](https://theodinproject.com/contributing)). The more you contribute, the more you will learn about what you can do, and the closer you will get to being hireable. These projects will also look great on your resume!


## Conclusion

- Course Approach: This course jumps around to a variety of topics that you may be totally unfamiliar with, providing you a small taste of each and then moving on.
